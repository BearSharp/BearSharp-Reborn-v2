# BearSharp-Reborn-v2
BearSharp Reborn v2 is a bot developed with the intention of being used in the Real Tibia. The project is 100% external and works with byte[] readings, unlike other external projects that work on a pixel basis. It contains several utility systems to facilitate your gameplay and does not require OBS Studio to read and work with the Tibia screen.
