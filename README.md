## 📝 **Description**
- ### **🔒 Impeccable Security!**
  - Highly advanced internal security systems and constantly updated bypasses ensuring complete security when using BearSharp in Tibia Global.
    - Use our bot comfortably and without worries.
- ### **👋 Eliminate OBS Studio!**
  - There is no need to use OBS Studio or any other third-party program to capture the Tibia Global screen. The entire process is executed internally by a Bypass developed specifically for this purpose, resulting in superior speed compared to traditional screen capture libraries. Additionally, it provides greater security against BattlEye.
    - The Perfect Bypass!
- ### **⚡️ Enhanced Performance | 💻 Reduced CPU Usage**
  - Optimized performance and drastically reduced CPU usage when dealing with preloaded images converted into bytes[].
    - Say goodbye to GetPixel!
- ### **🛡️ Advanced Anti-Spam**
  - Completely immune to spams or unnecessary conjurations! We have a complete internal system that faithfully simulates cooldowns and exhausts from Tibia Global, checks mana costs, and much more! Have perfect combos without depleting or spamming your spells!
    - Become the perfect player!
- ### **🚀 Instant and Efficient Response**
  - Thanks to all the high-level optimizations and extremely fast readings, the response time for BearSharp actions is practically instant! Benchmarks performed on the machine on which BearSharp was developed indicate a response time of 0 to 4 milliseconds on our systems.
    - Never suffer again from quick combos that could lead you to death without our tool!
